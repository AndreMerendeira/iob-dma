# IOb DMA Linux Kernel Drivers
- Structure:
    - `drivers/`: directory with linux kernel module drivers for iob_dma
        - `iob_dma_main.c`: driver source
        - `[iob_dma.h]` and `[iob_dma_sysfs.h]`: header files generated by:
        ```bash
        python3 .path/to/iob-linux/scripts/drivers.py iob_dma -o [output_dir]
        ```
        - `driver.mk`: makefile segment with `iob_dma-obj:` target for driver
          compdmation
    - `iob_dma.dts`: device tree template with iob_dma nodes
        - manually add the `dma` node to the system device tree so the iob_dma
          and iob_monitor is recognized by the linux kernel
